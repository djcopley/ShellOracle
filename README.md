## Introduction

Meet ShellOracle‚Äîa handy tool that makes working with the command line a bit smoother. This terminal utility lets you

  it'll generate the command for you.

* **Save Time, Stay Focused:** Say goodbye to manual command crafting. ShellOracle helps you save time and concentrate
  on what really matters by using natural language descriptions.

* **Adaptable to Your Needs:** Whether it's a quick one-liner or a sequence of commands, ShellOracle is flexible. It
  supports Unix pipes and keeps track of your command history.

* **Your Control, Your Way:** Run ShellOracle as a self-hosted utility to have complete control. Tailor it to your
  preferences and make it work just the way you want.

Give it a try and see how it fits into your workflow!

## Features

Key features of ShellOracle include:

* Seamless shell command generation from written descriptions
* Command history for easy reference
* Unix pipe support for advanced command chaining
* Self-hosted for full control over your environment
* Highly configurable to adapt to your preferences

## Installation

Installing ShellOracle is easy!

1. Pip install the `shelloracle` package
    ```shell
    python3 -m pip install shelloracle
    ```
2. Configure ShellOracle with `shelloracle configure` and follow the prompts
    ```shell
    python3 -m shelloracle configure
    ```
3. Refer to the [providers](#providers) section for specific details regarding your chosen provider.

## Usage

ShellOracle is designed to be used as a BASH/ZSH widget activated by the CTRL+F keyboard shortcut.

1. Press CTRL+F
2. Describe your command
3. Press Enter

The generated command will be inserted into your shell prompt after a brief processing period.

## Providers

### Ollama

Before using ShellOracle with Ollama, pull the model you chose in the configure step.
For example, if you chose `codellama:13b`, run:

```shell
ollama pull codellama:13b
```

Refer to the [Ollama docs](https://ollama.ai) for installation, available models, and usage.

### OpenAI

To use ShellOracle with the OpenAI provider, create an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Edit
your `~/.shelloracle/config.toml` to change your provider and enter your API key.

### LocalAI

Refer to the [LocalAI docs](https://localai.io/) for installation, available models, and usage.

### Other ways to run ShellOracle

ShellOracle can be run as a Python module with `python3 -m shelloracle` or using its entrypoint `shor`; however,
there are a few caveats with this method:
- Ensure your `~/.local/bin` directory is added to your PATH variable for the entrypoint to work.
- Running ShellOracle with this method will not automatically insert the result into your shell prompt.

### Tips

1. If you press CTRL+F with text in your ZLE buffer, all text left of your cursor will carry over to your ShellOracle
   prompt.
2. UP_ARROW and DOWN_ARROW cycle through your prompt history.
3. ShellOracle can be chained with other commands; try: `echo "find all the python files in my cwd" | shor`

## Configuration

ShellOracle's configuration is your gateway to tailoring the utility to match your preferences and requirements.
The `~/.shelloracle/config.toml` file serves as the control center for customizing various aspects of ShellOracle's
behavior.

## System Requirements

### Software

ShellOracle supports BASH and ZSH on macOS and Linux.

### Hardware

For cloud providers like OpenAI, there are no specific system requirements.

If self-hosting, system requirements vary based on the model used. Refer to the Ollama model registry for more
information.
